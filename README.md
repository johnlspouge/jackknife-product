# jackknife-product
Jackknife Product algorithm

The Python file 'jls_jackknifeproduct.py' contains a single public subroutine 

jackknifeProduct( g, operation )

Arguments:
g = commutative semigroup elements in a list
operation = commutative semigroup operation

Return:
gbar = a list of the len( g ) complementary products of g

The UNIX command 

'python jls_jackknifeproduct.py'

tests the components of Jackknife Product algorithm 
and should exit without complaint if the file passes its tests.
